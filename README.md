# Wazuh Configuration Result (`wresult`)

## Overview

`wresult` provides the exact, running configuration of a Wazuh agent by reconstructing how it applies ossec.conf and agent.conf. This tool is essential for compliance reporting and troubleshooting, ensuring that teams can see the actual settings enforced on an agent.

## Why Use wresult?

### The Problem

Wazuh agents dynamically apply configurations:

- ossec.conf is loaded first (local settings).
- agent.conf is fetched from the Wazuh manager and applied sequentially, overriding or appending settings.
- Conditional rules (e.g., OS-specific, profile-based configurations) determine the final applied settings.

As a result:

üîπ Compliance teams struggle to verify required security policies

üîπ Security engineers face difficulties troubleshooting unexpected agent behavior.

üîπ Administrators need a way to see the configuration exactly as the agent applies it.

### The Solution

‚úÖ Shows the real, running configuration‚Äînot just raw config files.

‚úÖ Resolves conflicts‚Äînewer policies override older ones.

‚úÖ Filters out irrelevant settings‚Äîonly applicable rules are included.

‚úÖ Saves time‚Äîeliminates manual inspection of multiple configuration files.


### Features

- Accurate Reconstruction ‚Äì Mirrors how Wazuh agents process configurations.
- Conflict Resolution ‚Äì Newer settings take precedence; others are appended.
- JSON Output ‚Äì Machine-readable, structured for automation and jq processing.
- HTML Report ‚Äì Interactive, easy-to-read configuration report.
- Supports Linux & Windows ‚Äì Uses standard Wazuh configuration paths.
